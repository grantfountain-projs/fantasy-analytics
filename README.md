# Fantasy Football Analytics Platform

A web-based analytics platform that provides superior fantasy football insights by predicting which players will outperform their weekly projections using advanced statistical modeling and multi-source data integration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Current fantasy platforms provide basic projections but miss crucial contextual factors. This platform identifies players likely to exceed projections by analyzing:
- Game script scenarios (spreads, over/unders)
- Usage patterns in specific situations
- Weather and environmental factors
- Historical performance vs projections

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- **Projection Beat Probability**: ML models predicting likelihood of exceeding ESPN/Yahoo projections
- **Game Script Analysis**: Identify players who benefit from specific game scenarios
- **Weekly Performance Reports**: Track model accuracy and improvement over time
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Clean web interface for exploring predictions and insights

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- PostgreSQL/SQLite for data storage
- pandas, numpy for data processing
- scikit-learn for ML models

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Chart.js/D3.js for visualizations
- Tailwind CSS for styling

**Data Sources:**
- ESPN Fantasy API
- Weather APIs
- Betting odds (free sources)
- NFL official statistics
